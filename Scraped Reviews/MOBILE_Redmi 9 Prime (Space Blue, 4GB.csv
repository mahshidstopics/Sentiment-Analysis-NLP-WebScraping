5,ADIL.T.M,"  We haven't seen the ‘Prime' branding on a Redmi smartphone in a really long time, but now Xiaomi has brought it back with the Redmi 9 Prime. Xiaomi explains that this model has been launched because its Redmi Note 9 series has become more expensive due to the GST hike and Rupee-Dollar fluctuations. The Redmi 9 Prime is priced below the Redmi Note 9 series and starts just below the Rs. 10,000 price point. Has Xiaomi gone overboard with cost-cutting, or does the Redmi 9 Prime offer you good value for money? I review the new Redmi 9 Prime to find out.At the beginning of our Redmi 9 Prime review, we stated that the smartphone is a prime contender for the best smartphone under Rs 10,000 currently in India. Redmi 9 Prime is a budget all-rounder that ticks most boxes right with its value-for-money performance package.The camera unit may not be the best but it gets the job done. The lack of night mode is a bummer though. You can pick Xiaomi’s own Redmi Note 9 (review) that gets points for its big battery, decent display and an above-average performance unitI bought it for youtube review but it changed me

6,Juliet,"  Very frustrating when you trying to purchase the phone since 4 months. Redmi phones are sold only through flash sales. I have been trying since so much time, but I haven't got even one. Very disappointing.
