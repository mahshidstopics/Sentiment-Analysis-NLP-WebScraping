4,Vinay Kumar Pandey,"  I have compare a samsung, Panasonic, and MI mobile. Mi is better in terms of bettery (5000mah) but all the other specifications are same in this range. I prefer samsung because of brand value and I don't want to buy Chinese products.This Mobile is good for average use and battery last for 24 hour. No heating problem.

6,I D Rathod,"  I have been using it for a week.I came back to samsung after using Redmi note and it feels so much better.The touch and feel iss awesome. Fast an smooth operations with anroid 10. Lots of intelligent features at this price like limiting screen time for each app and winddown function in the night etc.. Camera is decent for normal photo. Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations.The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher.Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.A good to buy phone for  9000
