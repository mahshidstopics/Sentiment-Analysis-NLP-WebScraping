3,PRABAHARAN,"  Here my product review after usage of 2 week.Pros:Design and built quality - superb.Display - Smoothness and view is very impressiveFinger print sensor and face unlock working  perfect.Rear camera - Good as considering the price.Ram management and multitasking - Just ok. Without any new applications it's consuming 1.8 gb.Call quality very fineCons:Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics gameBattery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate performFor charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100. I think MI mentioned just for advertisement.Macro camera - useless featureFront camera - AverageUi is fine but consuming more ramMany pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).FinalNormal user you can go (If you are ok to charge twice a day).If you are a game addict this product not at all suitable for you.Note: I am requesting replacement for my 1st mobile due to heating issue.Received 2nd one has battery draining issue. I am really disappointed to charge twice a day ( 5hrs per day). I suggest please buy some other brand don't waste your money like me.

6,Ansh satoeya,"  My Mobile phone has some screen issue. On completely black wall paper or black background there's a permanent white dot (like screen is defective) on the screen but i requested for the replacement soon device will be replaced. Although device is preety average, ram management is not that good.go for the snapdragon rather than mediatek.Pubg lags sometimes on medium settings and there's a ton of preloaded apps from which some apps you cannot uninstall.there are several options in the market other than xiaomi. So,choose your device wisely.
